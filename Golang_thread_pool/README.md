In Go, there is no built-in thread pool concept like in some other programming languages. Instead, Go provides goroutines and channels for concurrent programming. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, and channels are used for communication and synchronization between goroutines.
 
To create a goroutine-based concurrency model in Go, you don't need to explicitly create a thread pool. Instead, you can launch goroutines to perform concurrent tasks and utilize channels for communication between them.
 
Here's an example of how you can achieve concurrent execution in Go using goroutines and channels.

In this example, the `worker` function represents the task that each goroutine performs. It receives jobs from the `jobs` channel and sends the results back through the `results` channel.
 
The main function creates the channels, launches the worker goroutines, sends jobs to the jobs channel, collects the results from the results channel, and waits for all workers to finish using a sync.WaitGroup.
 
Note that the number of goroutines created represents the concurrency level, similar to a thread pool size. You can adjust the `numWorkers` variable to control the level of concurrency.
 
When you run this program, you'll see that the tasks are executed concurrently by multiple goroutines, and the results are printed as they become available.
